## Tidy Data - main points

-   Tidying refers to structuring datasets in a way that facilitates analysis

-   Tidy data has the following structure:

    -   each variable forms a column

    -   each observation forms a row

    -   each observational unit forms a table

-   There are many ways for data to be untidy.

-   Tidy tools have tidysets as inputs and outputs.
